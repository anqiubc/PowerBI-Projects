This repo stores all the dashboards I built in PowerBI. 
All the datasets that may have possible privacy concerns have been replaced with random numbers.

Hockey Canada is the national governing body of Hockey in Canada. In this project, our group aim to explore Hockey Canada’s data to identify trends, patterns, and correlations that may inform them to formulate strategies that will eventually increase growth and retention of hockey in Canada. In particular, we worked with the client to establish the key metrics calculation including overall retention rate, year over year retention rate, new participant rate, and average player’s lifespan. We also collected several open-source external data and aggregated them with our internal key metrics data. I used PowerBI to implement a dashboard to visualize the trends and correlations of the key metrics.
